# Predicting-Elastic-Behaviour-of-Tablet
Many issues in pharmaceutical manufacturing are direct consequence of tablet expansion which is caused by elastic behaviour of materials. To ensure quality of a product and facilitate industrial scale-up and manufacturing processes Quality by design principles must be employed. Prediction of elastic properties of granules if very important in pre-formulation and formulation studies. Therefore, prediction of elastic properties is very important in wet granulation scale-up process. In this experiment I set up few hypothesis testing to understand the data in better way and then, I try to evaluate different predictive models for the same data.
